# Prompt 7: Advanced Features (Future Work)

The base SocketCAN bridge is complete. Discuss future enhancements:

## Potential Features

### 1. CANopen Support

- SDO client implementation (expedited/segmented transfers)
- PDO mapping and routing
- NMT state machine
- Emergency (EMCY) message handling

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Zero-copy frame forwarding (if possible with SocketCAN API)
- Batch processing (read/write multiple frames per syscall)
- Lock-free queues for inter-thread communication

### 3. Advanced Filtering

- Per-ID routing rules (some IDs → SocketCAN, others → direct callbacks)
- CAN ID range subscriptions (e.g., all TPDO: 0x180-0x1FF)

### 4. Diagnostics

- CAN bus error detection (error frames, bus-off state)
- Latency measurement (USB → SocketCAN round-trip)
- Frame loss detection

### 5. Multi-Adapter Support

- Manage multiple Waveshare adapters (/dev/ttyCANBUS0, /dev/ttyCANBUS1)
- Bridge aggregation (merge traffic from multiple buses)

## Question

**Which feature would provide the most value for a CANopen motor controller application?**

Consider:
- Real-time performance requirements
- ROS2 integration patterns
- Debugging/monitoring needs
